## HELLO!

I'm Yiying Chen and you can call me Annie.\
I'm currently a graduate student at Columbia University studying bio statistics.\
I was born in China and completed my undergraduate degree in Queen's University in Canada. These experiences have taught me to value openness, empathy, and curiosity â€” the belief that learning from differences allows us to grow, connect, and create with greater understanding.
